              <h2>
                Punitive Perception
              </h2>
              <p>
                Many people view exercise as a punishment, especially those who are fat-shamed or have body image issues. They see it as "time" for their "crime". Fitting a healthy habit in your schedule with negative cues will make you feel worn out and want to quit.The solution is to clear your mind before starting a fitness regime and focus on the positive outcomes. See it as a fun activity rather than “hard labour".
              </p>
              <p>
                Feel the energy you once used to when paying hide and seek or making sandcastles. Kids never seem to run out of energy. The secret? They see their silly activities as fun and pleasurable. When you hit the dreaded elliptical machine with this positive approach, you will instantly notice the euphoria.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember, you are changing your lifestyle to improve your health. Tell yourself that the change is by you and for you only, not an inflicted punishment. You are answerable to yourself only.
              </p>
              <p>
                Drop the pressure and guilt. You could also take a walk down memory lane, thinking about what used to give you joy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Maybe it was the playful arm wrestling in high school. You can start it again; the sense of competition is more than enough and it will add much more meaning to your exercise.
              </p>

                Your partner is your best gym partner. They live with you and you both know each other's schedules.

                  Pairing your workouts with your better half means motivation is present inside and outside of the gym, and you two are constantly there to remind and push each other in a positive way.

                <li>
                  It is an excellent bonding ritual and it will make you comfortable with each other’s bodies. Give each other challenges in the gym.

                  Try bicep curls while holding your partner, it will test your back, biceps and shoulders while she will be strengthening her core by holding a plank position.
